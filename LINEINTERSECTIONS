Given n line segments lying on x-axis with starting points start and end points end, find the number of pairs of lines which overlaps.

Example

For n = 4, start = [8, 4, 6, 1] and end = [10, 9, 7, 2],
the output should be
lineIntersections(start,end) = 2.

The two intersecting lines are:

(4, 9) intersects with (6, 7);
(4, 9) intersects with (8,10).
For n = 2, start = [1, 2] and end = [3, 4],
the output should be
lineIntersections(start, end) = 1.

[input] integer n

The number of line segments, 1 ≤ n ≤ 20.

[input] array.integer start

Array of length n, the starting points of the segments. For each i start[i] ≥ 0.

[input] array.integer end

Array of length n, end[i] is greater than start[i] and is the ending point of the ith line segment.

[output] integer

The number of pairs of overlapping line segments.
